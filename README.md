I use and enjoy VScode and InteliJ. I use Obsidian to organize my notes. I use Click Up to organize my projects. I utilize WakaTime to gain a better grasp of how much time I spend on projects and what tech I focus on. Here you can see what I have done this week.

[Hermit Plus design](https://www.figma.com/file/1rA5nLglFEz6F1453wKwkG/Hermit-Plus?node-id=0%3A1) - View the Figma design. This file has the solution diagram, and is a working design the app is being built from.

[Hermit Plus code](https://github.com/Hermit-Plus) - Hermit Plus is a personal project. It gathers all the hermits in one place. Like Disney Plus but for hermits. Hermits are YouTube content creators that have created characters that build and play Minecraft. This project organizes and serves those url's with more of the feel of a streaming service rather than like YouTube.

[Hermit Plus landing](https://www.hermitplus.com) - Landing page to promote app. Built in ReactJs, put in AWS S3, distributed with Cloudfront. Site is highly available with low latency and responsive.

[Hermit Plus tech info](https://github.com/Developer3027/hermit_contact_form_aws) - Repo houses a solution diagram for the tech used, the code used, as well as  information and guidelines for what I did.

Meet a young man from Africa who wanted a place to sell his books online. This project sprang from talks with him. Project is currently in a private repo on Gitlab. Find the [demo site](https://book-shop-one.vercel.app) up on Vercel. Building with Next. Design and case study found on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/107569655/LIBRARY-PUBLISHING-HOUSE).

I am a Navy vet and I love sailing. I never get to do it. I have fallen in love with a few sailboat building channels. This project focuses on Salt and Tar but is part of the bigger picture. It is a concept that will include several such sites grouped into one, much like hermit plus. I am currently building with Amplify. You can get an idea from my [portfolio](https://github.com/Developer3027/mason-roberts) as the salt and tar concept is there. The project is set up on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/swabbie/salt-and-oak)

[Erudition](https://github.com/Developer3027/erudition-saa-c02) currently is a site built off my cliff notes from studing for SAA-C02. This site will be expanded to include free material for self taught web development and computer science resources. Has a discord server started in testing for future features. Currently you can review notes on certification topics or take a practice exam. Take a quick quiz before access to notes to get your mind thinking about the topic. [Erudition](https://erudition-saa-c02.vercel.app) is running on Vercel.
