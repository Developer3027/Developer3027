Hello! I have have been coding serious for just over a year. Back in the day I played around with HTML, XML and CSS, so returning to it and learning all the new things has been a blast! React was a challenge but is a great deal of fun. Currently, I am learning Java while playing with React, Express, MongoDB, and Okta.

I use and enjoy VScode as my IDE. It has many helpful features right out of the box, that make coding easier and enjoyable. One of the things I appreciate about it's design are the extensions. I utilize WakaTime to gain a better grasp of how much time I spend on projects and what tech I focus on. Here you can see what I have done this week.

[Kathryn Roberts](https://github.com/Developer3027/kathrynroberts-sc48) - Kate decided to run for the House seat 48 in South Carolina and wanted a simple web page that looked good, told her story, and presented information relevant to her area. I was sure to address SEO concerns and inserted meta tags for google, facebook, and twitter.

[Fathers United](https://github.com/Developer3027/FathersUnited) - This non profit based out of Charlotte, NC was looking for a web developer. I have been working with them over the past 6 months on design and tech. This is the mock up that is a work in progress. The main site is built in HTML and CSS. Currently I am working on providing a social network and learning center.
